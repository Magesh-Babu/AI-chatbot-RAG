# AI-chatbot-Application

This repository contains an AI-powered chatbot application built using Streamlit. The chatbot can answer both general queries and document-based queries. It leverages state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to provide accurate and context-aware responses.


Features

General Query Support: The chatbot can handle a wide range of questions based on general knowledge.

Document-Based Query Support: Users can upload documents, and the chatbot will provide relevant answers by retrieving and analyzing data from the uploaded files.

RAG Implementation: Incorporates Retrieval-Augmented Generation using LlamaIndex to handle external data sources effectively.

LLM Integration: Utilizes the powerful Llama 3 (8B) model deployed on Azure.

Embeddings: Uses an embedding model from Hugging Face for enhanced semantic search and document processing.
